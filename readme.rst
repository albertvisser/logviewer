LogViewer
=========

Originally a PHP application in an attempt to build a quick and dirty something to read my server logs from within my web browser, rebuilt in Python using various web frameworks.

The Python version uses Sqlite for storing its settings and caching the currently selected logfile.

Requirements
------------

- PHP for the old version
- Python for the new version
- CherryPy and Jinja2 for the current version
- Bottle and Flask for other Python versions
