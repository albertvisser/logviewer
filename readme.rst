LogViewer
=========

Originally a PHP application in an attempt to build a quick and dirty something to read my server logs from with my web browser, rebuilt in Python using several web frameworks.

Requirements
------------

- PHP for the old version
- Python for the new version
- CherryPy and Jinja2 for the current version
- Bottle and Flask for other Python versions
